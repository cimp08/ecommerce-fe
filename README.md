<!-- ## Goals

It seems that nowadays it is really hard to have a playmate or a walking buddy for your doggy. You might be thinking that an obvious choice could be family and friends dogs, but you need to be sure it is a good match. You want the best for your doggy. With our app we have a solution to that. We created an app where you can find the perfect match for your buddy. Our app allows your doggy to match with others based on gender or their interests and in the same time will ensure that playdates are fun for all involved. -->
